# machine-service
The application is to serve users as a web service - reporting individual services, machine inspections or failures. In the application, the user creates an account using the registration form - I used Spring Security here. Service history is stored in the database. Each client has access to the history of their websites. He plans to create e-mail notifications about the upcoming review date and chat between website users.
